# Azure Data Factory & DevOps Retail-Sales-Analytics End-to-End Project üöÄ

## üìñ Project Overview
This was my **first solo data engineering project on Azure**, built with the primary purpose of **learning** and practicing real-world workflows in Azure.  
All datasets used in this project are **dummy data generated for demonstration purposes only**.  

The project demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering solution** on **Azure**, integrated with **CI/CD pipelines** in **Azure DevOps**.  
The solution ingests raw data from multiple sources, transforms it using ADF Data Flows, and loads it into a **Data Lake** and **SQL Database** for analytics.  

The project follows **industry best practices** with **separate Dev, Test, and Prod environments** and automated deployments.

## üõçÔ∏è Business Background
The project simulates a **retail sales analytics scenario** where data is ingested from multiple sources, processed, and stored for analysis:

- **Customer & Sales Data (CSV)** ‚Üí uploaded to **Azure Blob Storage**, then ingested into the **Bronze (raw) layer** of the Data Lake.  
- **Product Data (JSON)** ‚Üí sourced from a **GitHub repository** using a **REST API linked service**, and also ingested into the **Bronze (raw) layer**.  
- **Exchange Rates & Currency Mapping** ‚Üí used to normalize sales across multiple currencies into **USD**.  

From there, the data was transformed, enriched, and aggregated to support business analytics such as **customer spending patterns** and **top product performance**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Factory Components
- **Pipelines** for orchestration  
- **Triggers** (Tumbling Window for scheduled loads) ![](https://github.com/RemyPat/End-To-End-Retail-Sales-Analytics-with-ADF-DevOps/blob/upload/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20at%2018.39.13.png)  
- **Activities**:
  - Copy Activity
  - Lookup Activity
  - For Each Activity ![](https://github.com/RemyPat/End-To-End-Retail-Sales-Analytics-with-ADF-DevOps/blob/upload/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20at%2019.08.54.png)
- **Transformations**:
  - Aggregate, Join, Select
  - Sorter, Derived Column
  - Sink & Source  
- **Data Flows** for data transformation ![](https://github.com/RemyPat/End-To-End-Retail-Sales-Analytics-with-ADF-DevOps/blob/upload/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20at%2018.43.47.png)

## üîÑ Data Pipeline Workflow
1. **Source Data** (dummy datasets):  
   - Customers (CSV)  
   - Products (JSON)  
   - Sales (CSV)  
   - Exchange Rates (JSON)  
   - Country-Currency mapping (CSV)  

2. **Transformations**:  
   - Join customers, sales, and product data  
   - Convert currencies to USD using exchange rates  
   - Derive `TotalSpendUSD` per customer and `TotalRevenueUSD` per product  
   - Aggregate data for reporting  

3. **Sink**:  
   - Store results in Azure Data Lake (CSV)  
   - Load curated data into Azure SQL Database for BI tools

## üöÄ DevOps CI/CD Setup
- **Build Pipeline**  
  - Generates ARM templates ![](https://github.com/RemyPat/End-To-End-Retail-Sales-Analytics-with-ADF-DevOps/blob/upload/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20at%2018.41.12.png)   
- **Release Pipeline**  
  - Deploys ADF pipelines automatically to **Dev ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Prod**  
  - Uses **pipeline variables** to reference environment-specific resources  
- **Two Deployment Approaches**:
  1. Manual publish ‚Üí Release pipeline trigger ![]([https://github.com/RemyPat/End-To-End-Retail-Sales-Analytics-with-ADF-DevOps/blob/upload/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20at%2018.40.52.png](https://github.com/RemyPat/End-To-End-Retail-Sales-Analytics-with-ADF-DevOps/blob/upload/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20at%2018.40.31.png))  
  2. Fully automated CI/CD (triggered after pull request approval ‚Üí build ‚Üí release) ![](https://github.com/RemyPat/End-To-End-Retail-Sales-Analytics-with-ADF-DevOps/blob/upload/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20at%2018.40.52.png)
